Once upon a time in a small town, there lived a mischievous monkey named alex. alex was known for his pranks and funny antics, and everyone in the town had a story to tell about his hilarious adventures.

One sunny day, alex decided to pay a visit to the local grocery store. As he walked through the aisles, he couldn't resist the temptation of the colorful fruits on display. His eyes sparkled mischievously as an idea popped into his head.

alex quickly climbed up to the top shelf where the watermelons were placed. He carefully picked one of the biggest watermelons and held it above his head. With a mischievous grin, he took aim and threw it towards the entrance of the store.

Unbeknownst to alex, the store owner, Mr. Johnson, had just stepped outside to grab a breath of fresh air. As luck would have it, the watermelon flew through the air with perfect precision, landing directly on Mr. Johnson's head.

The impact was so great that Mr. Johnson stumbled backward, completely shocked and covered in watermelon juice. Customers passing by burst into fits of laughter, unable to contain their amusement. Poor Mr. Johnson, drenched and bewildered, couldn't help but join in the laughter himself.

Meanwhile, alex, realizing the chaos he had caused, hid behind a nearby stack of bananas, trying to stifle his laughter. The sight of everyone laughing and Mr. Johnson's watermelon-covered face was simply too hilarious for him to resist.

As the laughter subsided, Mr. Johnson entered the store, wiping the watermelon juice off his face. He couldn't stay mad at alex for long, knowing it was just another one of his pranks. Instead, he simply shook his head and said, "That monkey sure knows how to keep things lively around here!"

From that day forward, alex became a local legend, and people would often share the tale of the watermelon incident, making everyone laugh all over again. And as for alex, he continued to entertain the town with his playful tricks.
